2) User plans to deploy Azure SQL database with table1 with several columns. You need to recommend method partitioning on table and it should include below requirements
  - Data must be retained for 2 years
  - Any data older than 2 years must be removed once a month.

Answer: 
	  Since the requirement is for years, ignore all related to months. Also Azure SQL supports partitioning but not user defined file groups.
    
    So, 
    create a partition function for year
    Create a partition group for PRIMARY group.
    Create table by using partition schema on column that has datetime datatype- (Since the partition is happening, it will be of datatime column data type)
