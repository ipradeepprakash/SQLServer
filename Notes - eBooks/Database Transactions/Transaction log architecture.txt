SQL Server: Transaction file

	When a transaction commits, 
				the changes the transaction made are finalized in the database and are durable in the SQL Server transaction log on disk. Note that I said, “in the transaction log.” The actual changes to the data file pages in memory are *not* written to disk when the transaction commits. They don’t need to be made durable in the data files because the changes are already durable in the transaction log. Eventually, the data file pages will be written to disk by a checkpoint operation.
	
	Conversely, when a transaction rolls back, 
				the data changes the transaction made are no longer present in the database. There will still be some physical changes in the database, as rolling back a transaction means performing more changes, but you can think of a rolled back transaction as not having affected the data in the database.
