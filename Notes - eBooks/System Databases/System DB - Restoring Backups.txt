*********Restoring of system databases**********

Steps to RESTORE Master databases
--------------------------------------
    # https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/backup-restore/restore-the-master-database-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15

	1) Start the server instance in single-user mode.
	2) To restore a full database backup of master, use the following RESTORE DATABASETransact-SQL statement:
		cmd>> RESTORE DATABASE master FROM <backup_device> WITH REPLACE
		note: After master is restored, the instance of SQL Server shuts down and terminates the sqlcmd process. Before you restart the server instance, remove the single-user startup parameter.
	3) Restart the server instance and continue other recovery steps such as restoring other databases, attaching databases, and correcting user mismatches.

# Instant file Initialization: https://www.sqlskills.com/blogs/kimberly/instant-initialization-what-why-and-how/

It’s a SQL Server 2005 feature that depends on Windows NTFS.
File allocation of size happens instantly irrespective of size (it does not start from zero / starting point of file initialization) to minimize the fragmentation.
